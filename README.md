# Python Spatial Programming with Geopandas
## Assignment

### Background
We previously worked with python within the framework of QGIS but python is most flexible when used in stand-alone mode, which allows us to decouple the QGIS framework libraries from the base libraries of python and explicitly add libraries of our own. As with other languages, the power of Python comes from the plethora of high-quality libraries that extend the base functionality of the core python programming language. In the realm of spatial python there are many libraries but we will start with a couple: `geopandas`, `shapely`, `rasterio`, and `rasterstats`.

Reference:
- [Shapely docs](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html)
- [Geopanda docs](http://geopandas.org/)

Docs can be good or bad. The docs for above range from "ok" to "good" (geopandas).
GeoPandas actually uses the `shapely` model for geometries and while it needs to be installed, there is little direct
interaction with this library on our part except for accessing the `shapely` geometries.

The objective of this lab is to reproduce one of the QGIS Tutorials you did previously:
- [Performing spatial joins](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/performing_spatial_joins.html)

## Deliverables
- `spatial_join.py`
- `spatial_join.png`

## Getting started with Spyder
Perform this work in `Spyder`. To access `Spyder` from the `Anaconda prompt`:
```
spyder
```
This will launch the Spyder IDE.

Notice the three panels. In the large panel on the left (labeled `Editor`) you can write python code and take notes. In the 
top right `Variable explorer`) you can see what variables are in scope and inspect their types and contents. In the bottom 
right ('iPython console') is an interactive python console. You can type python directly into the console or use the icons 
at the top of the `Editor` panel to send commands to the python console. Of note, the Gear icon in the console title bar
will allow you to restart the "`kernel`", which restarts python and gives you a fresh environment (with no declared 
variables or libraries imported).

In practice, it is good to use the `Editor` window to build a working program line by line, saving your progress as a new
python file, and then, after significant edits, restarting the kernel and running through the program line by line to make 
sure it works from start to finish.

The editor has a navigation bar that allows you to run a selection, a line, or the entire program:

## Part 1 - Performing spatial joins
Review [Performing spatial joins](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/performing_spatial_joins.html) to see our objective. 

### Download and extract the data:

- [NY Boros](http://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/nybb_19a.zip)
- [Pavement Ratings](http://www.qgistutorials.com/downloads/V_SSS_SEGMENTRATING_1.zip)

Open `Spyder` and create a new document in this repo named `spatial_join.py`.

### Load the data in python
We are going to use `geopandas` and `descartes` in this lab, so import them:
```
import geopandas
import descartes
```
`geopandas` can read shapefiles. Using the path to the extracted shapefile above:
```
nybb = geopandas.read_file('/Users/aaryno/classes/gist604b/fall-2019-online/data/nybb_19a/nybb.shp')
```
Next, do some basic exploration of the data and the python structures made from it:
```
print(nybb)
type(nybb)
nybb.head()
```
Note that the `.head()` method is acting _on_ the geopandas dataframe and will print the values of the first 5 lines. Next, plot it (the `.plot()` method is also acting on the geopandas dataframe and plots it using the `matplotlib` library:
```
nybb.plot()
```
Do the same for the street pavement rating:
```
vss = geopandas.read_file('/Users/aaryno/classes/gist604b/fall-2019-online/data/V_SSS_SEGMENTRATING_1/dot_V_SSS_SEGMENTRATING_1_20190129.shp')
```
And explore:
```
print(vss)
type(vss)
vss.head()
vss.plot()
```

### Subset the Streets data
Geopandas gives us the ability to use array-indexing to subset the data. Let's construct a filter to get rid of the data where `RatingWord` is not `NR`:

View the data:
```
vss['RatingWord']
```
Construct a list of boolean values equal to the length of `vss` in which the value is `True` if `RatingWord` is not equal to `NR` and False otherwise:
```
vss['RatingWord'] != 'NR']
```
Now we can subset `vss` based on which values of ^ are `True`:
```
vss_sub = vss[vss['RatingWord'] != 'NR']
```
Now we have a new `GeoDataFrame` named `vss_sub` with fewer rows. Take a look at its shape and compare to `vss` to confirm:
```
vss_sub.shape
vss.shape
```
### Perform spatial join between boros and streets:
Geopandas has an `sjoin` [[doc](http://geopandas.org/reference/geopandas.sjoin.html)] operator to perform spatial joins:
```
nybb_with_vss = geopandas.sjoin(nybb, vss_sub)
```
Take a look:
```
type(nybb_with_vss)
nybb_with_vss.head()
```

### Summarize stats
We have successfully given the streets the names of the boros they reside in. Not let's summarize. This functionality is
inherited from the `pandas` library:

```
mean_rating_by_boro = nybb_with_vss.groupby(['BoroCode'])['Rating_B'].mean()
```

This creates a data frame containing the mean of `Rating_B` bu `BoroCode` across the `nybb_with_vss` dataframe.
```
type(mean_rating_by_boro)
head(mean_rating_by_boro)
```

### Join pavement summary stats to boros
The above is just a table. To give those attributes to the original boros data we need to do a table join, which in 
geopandas parlance is `.merge()`:
```
nybb_with_mean_ratings = nybb.merge(mean_rating_by_boro, on='BoroCode' )
nybb_with_mean_ratings.head()
```

### Deliverable
Save your final python file as `spatial_join.py` in this repository. Additionally, take a screenshot showing the results
of the final step in Part 1 and save it as `spatial_join.png`.
